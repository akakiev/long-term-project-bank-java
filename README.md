# Java Application to Implement Bank Functionality

The java program developed here is to implement bank functionality. The user can create an account, check,  deposit money, withdraw, and also search account. At first, we created an interface called the central bank to do a few operations mentioned above. Then we created three subclass UNB, FGB, and NBD these classes will take customer account details and then we created a class Bankdriver to invoke all the methods in the subclasses.
